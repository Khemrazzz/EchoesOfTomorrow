# EchoesOfTomorrow

EchoesOfTomorrow is a small web game built with the Construct game engine. The project was inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and encourages players to think about creating a brighter, more sustainable future.

## Game Premise
In this sideâ€‘scrolling platformer you guide a futuristic hero through short levels, defeating enemies and collecting coins while avoiding traps. Each stage represents an echo of a possible tomorrow, highlighting themes of environmental stewardship and responsible resource use.

## Playing the Web Build Locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. From the project directory, start a simple HTTP server and open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server
   # or using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown) to play.

Running from a local server is required because modern browsers restrict certain features when opening the file directly from disk.

## Contributing / Building
All game assets found here are the web export from Construct. If you want to modify or expand the game you can:
1. Fork this repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Edit the HTML/CSS/JavaScript files directly or open the Construct project (if available) to modify the source and export a new build.
3. Submit a pull request describing your changes.

Feel free to file issues for bugs or feature suggestions. Contributions that align with the SDG themes are particularly welcome.
